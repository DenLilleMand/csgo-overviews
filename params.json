{"name":"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive map overviews","tagline":"Unlabelled overviews for competitive CS: GO maps, useful for planning strategies and positioning.","body":"# Counter-Strike: Global Offensive map overviews\r\n\r\nThis is a collection of radar overviews, and eventually thumbnails,\r\nin more usable formats, with scripts for easily updating them.\r\nThe scripts use [pyglet](https://warehouse.python.org/project/pyglet/) to convert \r\nthe raw DDS files to PNG files, and then [Pillow](https://warehouse.python.org/project/Pillow/) to resize\r\nthe PNG files.\r\n\r\nThe converting stuff should work for any DDS files to PNG.\r\n\r\nIf you're just looking for image versions of the maps, go to the [Releases](https://github.com/zoidbergwill/csgo-overviews/releases)\r\nand get the latest [`overviews.zip`](https://github.com/zoidbergwill/csgo-overviews/releases/download/0.0.1/overviews.zip)\r\n\r\n## Updating the overviews\r\n\r\n* Prepare the virtualenv:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n  virtualenv virtualenv\r\n  . virtualenv/bin/activate\r\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Drop the `.dds` files from `common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/resource/overviews` in\r\n`csgo-overviews/overviews/raw`.\r\n\r\n* Run the script:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n  scripts/update_overviews.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nContributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every\r\nlittle bit helps, and credit will always be given.\r\n\r\n### Report Bugs\r\n\r\nReport bugs using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/zoidbergwill/csgo-overviews/issues?state=open).\r\n\r\nIf you are reporting a bug, please include:\r\n\r\n* Your operating system name and version.\r\n* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.\r\n* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n### Fix Bugs\r\n\r\nLook through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with \"bug\"\r\nis open to whoever wants to implement it.\r\n\r\n### Implement Features\r\n\r\nLook through the GitHub issues for features.

Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
